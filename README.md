# critique

Permanent critical mindset for Claude Code. Every response surfaces real bugs, questionable decisions, and unhandled edge cases — ordered by impact. No sugarcoating.

---

## Before / After

**Without critique:**
> "This looks good overall! A few minor things to consider..."

**With critique:**
> 🔴 **Security:** `userId` comes from request body without validation — attacker controls it. Read from session token instead.
>
> 🟡 **Design:** `processOrder` does DB write + email in the same function — partial failure leaves inconsistent state. Wrap in transaction or split into two operations.

## What it does

Injects a permanent critical mindset into every session via a `SessionStart` hook. Active on every response, every task:

| What | How |
|---|---|
| **Real problems** | Bugs, security flaws, unexpected behaviors, unhandled edge cases. Only what actually breaks. |
| **Questionable decisions** | Architecture/implementation choices that will cause pain later — with explanation and alternative. |
| **What's good** | Only if non-obvious and worth reinforcing. No praising the obvious. |
| **Priority** | Ordered by real impact, not ease of fix. |

Applies to: code, review, brainstorm, plan, architecture, decisions.

## Skills

### `/critique`
Activate the critical mindset explicitly for the current session.

### `/rigorous`
Deep analysis mode before coding, reviewing, or planning. Five-phase protocol:
pre-flight → security audit → implementation audit → structured output → STOP protocol.

Supports focused modes: `/rigorous plan <task>` · `/rigorous sec` · `/rigorous impl` · `/rigorous code`
